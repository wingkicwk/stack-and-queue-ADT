    "The stack ADT is a abstract data type that elements are placed on top of each other and all new element are added to the top of the stack. A stack is bascially a group of objects that inserted and removed are performed at only one end, whcih is the top of the stack and is based on the last in first out(LIFO)principle. Therefore, we can say that a stack is ordered since elements appear in sequence based on how long they have been in the stack, and everytime only the last element, i.e. the most recently inserted one can be removed. In the implementation of stack adt, other than sotring data in each node, the pointer to data is stored. A stack ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following key operations can be performed by stack ADT:\n",
    "- push() – Insert an element at one end of the stack which called top.\n",
    "- pop() – Remove and return the element at the top of the stack, if it is not empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following support operations can also be performed by stack ADT:\n",
    "- top() – Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it, if the stack is not empty.\n",
    "- size() – Return the number of elements in the stack.\n",

Every time when a user visit a website, the address of that website is stored by 'pushing' to the stack of addresses, and thus the user is allowed to 'pop' back to the websites that visited previously using the browser's back button if he'she wants.\n",

Although elements can be added to a queue at any time, only the one that stay in the queue for the longest time may be removed. A queue ADT can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.\n",
